# Collatz

This repository contains a collection of cool code inspired by and supplementing research on the Collatz conjecture. The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3x + 1 problem, is a mathematical problem that remains unsolved and fascinates both mathematicians and enthusiasts worldwide.

## Features

- Scripts to compute Collatz sequences.
- Analysis of unit digits and iterations required to reach specific numbers.
- Tools to explore properties and patterns in the Collatz sequences.
